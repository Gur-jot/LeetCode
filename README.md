# LeetCode
1. Two Sum problem
problem:- Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.
Solution code in c++ :- 

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        int a=0;
        int b=0;
        for(int i=0;i<nums.size()-1;i++)
        {
            for(int j=i+1;j<nums.size();j++)
            {
                if(nums[i]+nums[j]==target)
                {
                    a=i;
                    b=j;
                }
            }
        }
        return {a,b};
    }
};
    
    
    
  
    
Palindrome Number:
    Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer.

An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

For example, 121 is a palindrome while 123 is not.
 
    public class Solution {
    public bool IsPalindrome(int x) {
        // Special cases:
        // As discussed above, when x < 0, x is not a palindrome.
        // Also if the last digit of the number is 0, in order to be a palindrome,
        // the first digit of the number also needs to be 0.
        // Only 0 satisfy this property.
        if(x < 0 || (x % 10 == 0 && x != 0)) {
            return false;
        }

        int revertedNumber = 0;
        while(x > revertedNumber) {
            revertedNumber = revertedNumber * 10 + x % 10;
            x /= 10;
        }

        // When the length is an odd number, we can get rid of the middle digit by revertedNumber/10
        // For example when the input is 12321, at the end of the while loop we get x = 12, revertedNumber = 123,
        // since the middle digit doesn't matter in palidrome(it will always equal to itself), we can simply get rid of it.
        return x == revertedNumber || x == revertedNumber/10;
    }
}
